## Why did we choose this idea?

This idea came from having a problem with managing money on our account. Each month we make budget for whole month based on the income, but it is always difficult not to spent more than we have expected, because after each purchase we should calculate by ourself how much money we still have for food or for entertainment and so on. Such app will make it easier for us, and with open Bank API it will automatically receive and sort transactions. App will calculate money left on fraction based on previous transactions and we will see how much money we still have for what aim. Another aspect is to help to save money. Also we wanted to implement some achievements and make app more game-like to make saving money more fun but we ran out of time.
